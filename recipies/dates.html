    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Bacon-Wrapped Dates</strong> are a delicious appetizer that combines the sweet, chewy texture of dates with the savory, crispy texture of bacon. These bites are perfect for parties, gatherings, or as a snack on a quiet evening.</p>
    <p>The combination of dates and bacon creates a unique flavor profile that is both sweet and savory, while the bacon adds a satisfying crunch and smoky flavor.</p>

        <li>Dates: Use pitted dates for easy wrapping. You can use Medjool dates for their rich sweetness.</li>
        <li>Bacon: Use thick-cut bacon for better texture and flavor. You can also use turkey bacon for a leaner option.</li>
        <li>Optional: A sprinkle of brown sugar or cinnamon can enhance the sweetness and add extra flavor.</li>
